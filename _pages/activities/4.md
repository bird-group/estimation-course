## Activity 4 -- Process Control
### Introduction
Mobile robots are far from the only systems which make use of state estimation. We will explore the use of state estimation in a process control problem, where a surrogate chemical reactor vessel must be filled with a mixture of reactants. The dynamics model of the system may not be clear and failures in some systems may occur, we will explore parameter estimation and advanced nonlinear estimators while working with a small model of a simple chemical mixing system.
