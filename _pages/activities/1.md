## Activity 1 -- GPS
### Introduction
GPS is ubiquitous as a positioning and timing distribution technology. At heart it is completely dependent on solving a theoretically straightforward estimation problem known as multilateration. The marvel of GPS is both its theoretical simplicity and practical complexity. We will explore GPS through solution of the multilateration problem on simulated, recorded GPS, and live GPS data streams.
