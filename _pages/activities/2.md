## Activity 2 -- Collision Mitigation
### Introduction
Forward collision mitigation systems are becoming common on automobiles. These systems combine observations of basic automotive state with forward-looking sensors to identify when the vehicle should automatically apply the brakes to mitigate or prevent a collision. These sensors can be combined using a classic Kalman filter approach. We will implement Kalman filters to determine the position of a surrogate car (a small robot) relative to an obstacle. We will see how different sensor modalities are complementary and how the Kalman filter allows them to be combined. The estimated position will be used to generate a "stop" command to mitigate or prevent a collision.
