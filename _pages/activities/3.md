## Activity 3 -- AHRS
### Introduction
AHRS combine multiple sources of information to produce an estimate of the orientation of an object. Commoditization of the sensors has led to an explosion in the use of orientation information in consumer products. Fitness trackers, smartphones, drones, automobiles, and myriad other systems now use attitude information provided by an AHRS. Determining attitude is not trivial however, multiple sensors must be combined, none of which provides a clear observation of the orientation of an object, and the rotational dynamics of a system are nonlinear, complicating the estimation problem. We will develop an AHRS using the sensors from a drone autopilot.
